# AWS Data Security Framework

## Overview
Implemented a robust data security framework on AWS using Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and Key Management Service (KMS) encryption. This solution ensures secure access control and protects sensitive data at rest and in transit.

## Architecture
- **IAM policies** enforce least-privilege access
- **KMS** handles encryption for S3, RDS, and Lambda
- **CloudTrail** logs all access and key usage

## Tools & Services
- AWS IAM
- AWS KMS
- Amazon S3 (encrypted)
- AWS CloudTrail

## Outcome
- Achieved compliance with industry security standards
- Strengthened access control and data encryption

## Future Enhancements
- Automate IAM a
